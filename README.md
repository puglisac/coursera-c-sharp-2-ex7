# Exercise 7: Gravity, It's Just a Theory

This is an exercise for the coursera course [More C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/more-programming-unity)

### Problem 1 - Determine abstraction for the apple

In this game, the apple is supposed to provide health to the player (Newton) when the player collides with the apple. Decide what details are important for the apple for this problem.

### Problem 2 - Implement the apple abstraction

Add the Apple.cs file from the zip file to the scripts folder and attach it to the Apple prefab. Open the Apple script to see the field and property I implemented for the apple abstraction for this problem.

### Problem 3 - Add code to Newton

Add code to the Newton script to add the amount of health the apple provides and print out the new health to the Console window when Newton collides with an apple. Destroy the apple as well.

Remember, you can use the **GetComponent** method to get a reference to a script attached to a game object.
